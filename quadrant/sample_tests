I reconsidered many thing and my approach is moronic, but interesting.
Quadrant is the main mystery for many people and they discuss it in any direction. The main question is always: what is the origin of that structure? First collocation is simple math. However, in my opinion, quadrant is an attempt to describe the singular person and the expasion of counciousness in every single human being. 
It is necessary to understand the basics of quadrant, maybe I am writing something obvious, but the interpretation must be simple. Quadrant is the theoretical method to describe evolution or existance of a person. Within the quadrant you may see greater structures emerging from the center. 
The main 'I' perspective is above the axis of Y, below is the 'We' perspective, that entangles everyone. But the plain explanation is this:
quadrant describes in direct way, how structured is counciousness, but mostly important - the way how eyes or eyesight is actually 'working' during thinking/experiencing/living. Each moment, during spontaneous situation, eyes directly move according to quadrant. 
When you get that idea, watch the movement of eyes of people on live videos, especially those, who are not accustomed to be recorded. It is easy to explain that on many examples. 

My 'funny comments' that are not meant to mean anything, but are the easy comparison of symbols in context of quadrant.
A. Christian cross.
Usually cross is non-symetrical, so we may put it into the quadrant with the horizontal bar above the axis of Y of quadrant. That would mean that a christian believer, in symbolical intepretation, suppresses the 'I' that goes up toward higher self, but leaves no expansion or actual borders on the 'We'. Cross covers the main lines, but there is no wide-spread coverage on anything. Furthermore, the horizontal bar of the cross, somehow interacts with the 'I', puts pressure, so the way to higher self is the only way up, which might be true or is true, but the 'I' is something that is not meant to be free - each moment it has to be reconsidered or put as an object of a joke. Path to higher self with condensation of true, single self. To put it straightforward: 'I' of a human is nothing in the eye of higher self, so there must be some tension and confusion. Path to God is always admirement with a bit of guilt, that christian is only 'I', but this 'I' is the only ground directing to the 'highest high'.
B. Judaism.
Symbol of Judaism put into quadrant mainly covers it all and draws harsh borders. In my imagination and some knowledge - Judaism demends true devotion to studying the models of a man/woman, years of learning the teachings preserved in saint books. It's a strong and
