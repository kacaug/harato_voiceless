1. it is adviced to read in RAW form
2. integralworld - hall of fame of people questioning integral theory (i mean that respectfully, have to underline that); integrallife - still active, but paid option is the only good choice; free content usually is only a bait;
3. whole integral theory, in my opinion, is rather an intellectual attempt to outline the space for any theory within integral theory, so this theory is in some sort of way non-existant, but can 'find place' for any person, society, politics, worldviews and religion without targeting anyone in any direction - you get to know integral thoery and you remain with nothing afterwards as you were before comprehending it;
4. meditation/prayer is for people 25. and above; true meditation or devotion towards meditation is probably a way of sacrificing life; main clues: there is no wrong meditation (Chopra words), start with 1 minute, then maybe 5; search for different meditation and stick to one; christian contemplation is simplies - choose one word and use it as mantra (example: door - nice word, it should be short, 2-3 syllables; find your position (perhaps endless topic); meditation is work - one spiritual man described in a book that 2x30 min is the optimum effort in one year span - that can be cool, can be destructive as well;
5. support Shambala and just buy Wilber anthology - not a big sum (relative, ofc), but worth the money; or buy a book of one of Alumni or person of Integral Studies
