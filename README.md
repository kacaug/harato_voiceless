1. it is adviced to read in RAW form
2. integralworld - hall of fame of people questioning integral theory; integrallife - still active, but paid option is the only good choice; free content usually is only a bait;
3. whole integral theory, in my opinion, is rather an intellectual attempt to outline the space for any theory within integral theory, so this theory is in some sort of way non-existant, but can 'find place' for any person, society, politics, worldviews and religion without targeting anyone in any direction - you get to know integral thoery and you remain with nothing afterwards as you were before comprehending it;
