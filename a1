Thery is plain simple and the wickedness is in the concept: 'yo guys, i summarized all stuff and that's that, fuck off'. Many people on integralworld have been publishing for years, commenting on Wilbers concept. I have read some of this, but mainly they just monitor Wilber or keep publishing. Visser is the CEO. Most of their content is infortunately something like this 'yo, wilber shit, ur concept has 100 points, but look at point 23 and 98 and those are the glitches i commented in 5000 words below'. I think that makes the concept even more interesting. One guy had some 'spiritual experience' and stopped commenting. Strange?
I have read some books, but light in number of pages and i learned not much and i was not satisfied. So I usually go to the old stuff. SES is interesting, Religion of New Tommorow is also fine, but those are just updates. Nothing new, but more elaborate and 'hit-in-the-face' form.
Main elements are: levels of counciousness which define the level of reality that is perceived (or something like that), spirituality that can be called by any name you call spirituality, the interiority or just the I, structure of society and evolution of society, a 'way of experiencing God' or just a concept that defines the God within a human being is a potential that remains in a movement. So God within is not a stable state/potential, but can be developed and mostly remains unspoken, but drives the approach toward life or other people.
