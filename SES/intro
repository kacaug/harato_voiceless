Thery is plain simple and the wickedness is in the concept: 'yo guys, i summarized all stuff and that's that, fuck off'. Many people on integralworld have been publishing for years, commenting on Wilbers concept. I have read some of this, but mainly they just monitor Wilber or keep publishing. Visser is the CEO. Most of their content is infortunately something like this 'yo, wilber shit, ur concept has 100 points, but look at point 23 and 98 and those are the glitches i commented in 5000 words below'. I think that makes the concept even more interesting. One guy had some 'spiritual experience' and stopped commenting. Strange?
I have read some books, but light in number of pages and i learned not much and i was not satisfied. So I usually go to the old stuff. SES is interesting, Religion of New Tommorow is also fine, but those are just updates. Nothing new, but more elaborate and 'hit-in-the-face' form.
Main elements are: levels of counciousness which define the level of reality that is perceived (or something like that), spirituality that can be called by any name you call spirituality, the interiority or just the I, structure of society and evolution of society, a 'way of experiencing God' or just a concept that defines the God within a human being is a potential that remains in a movement. So God within is not a stable state/potential, but can be developed and mostly remains unspoken, but drives the approach toward life or other people.
Quick look at the Table of Contents:
- web of life - most probably another version put in words of great chain of being plus wilber shit like 'u know life is life, but meanwhile its a great ride' - visit Auschwitz for the weekend fuckhead
- pattern that connects - the same as above plus tenets plus wise quotes that attract the reader, me too, so i spend some hours at libraries
- individual and social - most probably the paradoxes between a singularity of human being and all the rest that is attached by just living life
- a view from within - that's fucking anybody looking anywhere, reading anything, doing anything; most important - that person has to be alive, tricky one;
- emergance of human nature - approach toward the evolution of human being/human creature/darwin-like approach, so that's the direct point that a person began from the atom/fish/ape to human
- magic, mythic and beyond - Gebser i guees, so just levels of perceiving the reality - councious or uncouncious that affect the person - simples example: affect rationality, state of psyche and the main point is - no matter who you are, there is now way of disattaching from the minor levels and you have to do 'work' on yourself throught lifetime, each day probably;
- the farther reaches... - if you accept all that is contained in theory, something above the theory awaits, so elighment/spirituality/jehowah witnessess/maniacs thorned by 'godish ideas' are not wrong all the time;
- the depths of divine - God within the person is structured as well and has some sort of 'movement' within each person that relies on situation or just by the mood or in example: during the conference talks or buying flowers;
- the way up is the way down - God mentioned earlier is structured irrationally - its a constans that knows no up, no down or we might say it fluctuates, but the main up can be the main down so it is not to be comprehended easily;
- this-world, otherworldy - i remember shit about that, but i remember something;
- brave new world - title of a book by other guy, so that's a fraud or some other 'crime label'; so the main reason beind this is that Wilber imagines different future or points out that this title had more to do than just a title;
- collapse of Kosmos - strange words, but it was a matter of comprehending the reality that is mainly godless and there is no turning back to God in any way; this is quick comment;
- dominance of decenders - people, who are torn, by the fact there is no God anymore and all we can do is mourn and fight any other God than it was earlier - no matter the religion a person chose or was chosen by;
- unpacking of god - there is hope, my friend; hope is just another bullshit word, but definition is nice;
